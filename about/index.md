<p>My name is Brylian Foronda. I graduated from UH Manoa in Fall 2012 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I am currently working full-time as an IT Manager for the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel and part-time as a Web Application Developer for RCUH. When time permits, I enjoy programming, working out, watching movies and sleeping. <p>
